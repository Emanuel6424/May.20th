        <h1> Our Timeline</h1>
        <p>My point of view of the past year with my favorite person :)</p>
        <p>As the title and message below entail, this webite was made to tell
            our story and highlight moments that were not only signficant but thought I should go into a bit more
            detail.
            I love you so much Shannon, AND ALTHOUGH YOU ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING, I hope that you were still
            surpirsed
            nontheless and that you enjoy it. Thank you for the best year that I can ask for, and I look forward to
            coming back to
            this unfinished project and adding more to it, cause believe it or not this is just the
            beginning (You are kinda stuck with me). I'll shut the hell up now though and let you go on and read this, I
            love you once again Shannon,
            I can't wait till you come back and we can celabrate in person, with much love
            - Emanuel Sanchez</p>

                <h2>February 2023</h2>
                <p>February, man this was a really interesting month. Going backwards in time, we had our first date on
                    02/25/2023 at Hops. Although you already know the story, I’ll jsut stress the fact that Shannon was
                    nervous. Like I got ready an hour and a half early and had a YouTube video going as to what not to
                    do on a first date. Ridiculous I know but it was no help because as soon as we met up, everything
                    just flew out the window lmao, and although this happened it didn’t matter because while I was
                    partly in fight or flight you were really easy to talk to and I was able to be dumb and myself (for
                    the most part still tried to play it cool you know???). The main thing was that I just couldn’t let
                    there be an awkward silence, which from what you told me I did a pretty good job of so I’ll pat
                    myself on the back for that. The other thing was my horrendous haircut. Oh my goodness Shannon was I
                    stressing over my haircut since I was just regrowing it from a buzzcut lmao, and you know the whole
                    thing which Snapchat and sending snaps part of the story lmao. The exact date we matched was
                    02/14/2023 Valentine's Day of all days lmao. I don’t know exactly because well I would need to
                    download Bumble back again to check and well… I am not doing that. But I say this month because I
                    knew it was a week after I was rejected from U of M. The month in which. This would mark the
                    beginning of an amazing unexpected journey

                    <h2>February 2023</h2>

                    <p> March, March, March… Wasn’t this a month? Starting from the beginning, it would be this month on
                        03/04/2023 I got to see you dance for the first time (DANCE 49)!! I was very excited to see it,
                        but
                        it was also really early into us knowing each other and I didn’t want to come off as creepy if I
                        went cause I didn’t know how you’d feel about it, so it get validation of going I called my
                        sisters
                        to get advice if I should or not and well… they said no ahahaha (they thought the same thing…
                        who
                        would’ve thought it’s not like we grew up with each other lmao). BUUUUUUUUUUT like the wingmen
                        they
                        are Alex and Avery came through and suggested we go to Dance 49 well… more like me BUT
                        NONETHELESS
                        WE WERE OFF TO GO SEE YOU!!! And as perusal you did amazing I just would’ve like to tell you
                        that in
                        person but what happened? Oh yeah, I fucking froze :| And Alex clocked it, which was when I
                        figured
                        out that he knew that we were talking lmao. After the performance though Alex and I started to
                        play
                        FIFA and we were snapping as usual to which we talked about the conversation that you and Sophia
                        had. This would commence my headass to overthink whether or not you liked me ahahaha, because
                        you
                        were kinda being discrete about it and so I just kinda thought you didn’t like me. Regardless I
                        really liked you but I didn’t want to come off as needy, so I told myself I would act my usual
                        self
                        and still see where things go from here but I also had to be cool and accept the fact that it
                        might
                        not go anywhere and to get hurt. Which I did but with every day that I go to know you more, I
                        found
                        my feelings to growing stronger but again I didn’t know if you felt the same was so I tried to
                        play
                        it cool, hence the infamous situation in which you told me “yeah it not like you have a crush on
                        me
                        or anything…” and I replied with “as for the other comment, well I am not gonna comment on that”
                        which I thought hinted at that I liked you cause you know you left me speechless but I
                        understand
                        those were a really poor choice of words, but again I was trying to play it cool!! All this
                        would
                        eventually bring us to 03/28/2023 in which I got that snap (still didn’t have your number…
                        ahahaha
                        my bad) asking if I liked you or not, to which I responded with “Did you wanna go for a walk?” I
                        knew I wanted to do it over a person because although I could’ve been wrong and you’d just flat
                        out
                        tell me that you didn't like me, I was willing to take the chance because I felt it would be
                        more
                        personal that way, and eventually when we’d date, and last I wouldn’t want to remember this
                        moment
                        as a simple text, but instead a memory that we can reflect on and reminisce. Knowing your
                        perspective of the build-up to you asking me this question is just hilarious to me, but anyway,
                        it
                        would be this walk in which we avoided the question for like an hour or so and after cringing
                        ourselves out for a bit (because we can’t express our feelings) we’d clear everything up by
                        admitting to each other that we liked the other (as if it wasn't obvious but apparently to us it
                        wasn’t…).
