        <h1> Our Timeline</h1>
        <p>My point of view of the past year with my favorite person :)</p>
        <p>As the title and message below entail, this webite was made to tell
            our story and highlight moments that were not only signficant but thought I should go into a bit more
            detail.
            I love you so much Shannon, AND ALTHOUGH YOU ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING, I hope that you were still
            surpirsed
            nontheless and that you enjoy it. Thank you for the best year that I can ask for, and I look forward to
            coming back to
            this unfinished project and adding more to it, cause believe it or not this is just the
            beginning (You are kinda stuck with me). I'll shut the hell up now though and let you go on and read this, I
            love you once again Shannon,
            I can't wait till you come back and we can celabrate in person, with much love
            - Emanuel Sanchez</p>

                    <h2>February 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>February, man this was a really interesting month. Going backwards in time, we had our first date
                        on
                        02/25/2023 at Hops. Although you already know the story, I’ll jsut stress the fact that Shannon
                        was
                        nervous. Like I got ready an hour and a half early and had a YouTube video going as to what not
                        to
                        do on a first date. Ridiculous I know but it was no help because as soon as we met up,
                        everything
                        just flew out the window lmao, and although this happened it didn’t matter because while I was
                        partly in fight or flight you were really easy to talk to and I was able to be dumb and myself
                        (for
                        the most part still tried to play it cool you know???). The main thing was that I just couldn’t
                        let
                        there be an awkward silence, which from what you told me I did a pretty good job of so I’ll pat
                        myself on the back for that. The other thing was my horrendous haircut. Oh my goodness Shannon
                        was I
                        stressing over my haircut since I was just regrowing it from a buzzcut lmao, and you know the
                        whole
                        thing which Snapchat and sending snaps part of the story lmao. The exact date we matched was
                        02/14/2023 Valentine's Day of all days lmao. I don’t know exactly because well I would need to
                        download Bumble back again to check and well… I am not doing that. But I say this month because
                        I
                        knew it was a week after I was rejected from U of M. The month in which. This would mark the
                        beginning of an amazing unexpected journey

                    <h2>March 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> March, March, March… Wasn’t this a month? Starting from the beginning, it would be this month on
                        03/04/2023 I got to see you dance for the first time (DANCE 49)!! I was very excited to see it,
                        but
                        it was also really early into us knowing each other and I didn’t want to come off as creepy if I
                        went cause I didn’t know how you’d feel about it, so it get validation of going I called my
                        sisters
                        to get advice if I should or not and well… they said no ahahaha (they thought the same thing…
                        who
                        would’ve thought it’s not like we grew up with each other lmao). BUUUUUUUUUUT like the wingmen
                        they
                        are Alex and Avery came through and suggested we go to Dance 49 well… more like me BUT
                        NONETHELESS
                        WE WERE OFF TO GO SEE YOU!!! And as perusal you did amazing I just would’ve like to tell you
                        that in
                        person but what happened? Oh yeah, I fucking froze :| And Alex clocked it, which was when I
                        figured
                        out that he knew that we were talking lmao. After the performance though Alex and I started to
                        play
                        FIFA and we were snapping as usual to which we talked about the conversation that you and Sophia
                        had. This would commence my headass to overthink whether or not you liked me ahahaha, because
                        you
                        were kinda being discrete about it and so I just kinda thought you didn’t like me. Regardless I
                        really liked you but I didn’t want to come off as needy, so I told myself I would act my usual
                        self
                        and still see where things go from here but I also had to be cool and accept the fact that it
                        might
                        not go anywhere and to get hurt. Which I did but with every day that I go to know you more, I
                        found
                        my feelings to growing stronger but again I didn’t know if you felt the same was so I tried to
                        play
                        it cool, hence the infamous situation in which you told me “yeah it not like you have a crush on
                        me
                        or anything…” and I replied with “as for the other comment, well I am not gonna comment on that”
                        which I thought hinted at that I liked you cause you know you left me speechless but I
                        understand
                        those were a really poor choice of words, but again I was trying to play it cool!! All this
                        would
                        eventually bring us to 03/28/2023 in which I got that snap (still didn’t have your number…
                        ahahaha
                        my bad) asking if I liked you or not, to which I responded with “Did you wanna go for a walk?” I
                        knew I wanted to do it over a person because although I could’ve been wrong and you’d just flat
                        out
                        tell me that you didn't like me, I was willing to take the chance because I felt it would be
                        more
                        personal that way, and eventually when we’d date, and last I wouldn’t want to remember this
                        moment
                        as a simple text, but instead a memory that we can reflect on and reminisce. Knowing your
                        perspective of the build-up to you asking me this question is just hilarious to me, but anyway,
                        it
                        would be this walk in which we avoided the question for like an hour or so and after cringing
                        ourselves out for a bit (because we can’t express our feelings) we’d clear everything up by
                        admitting to each other that we liked the other (as if it wasn't obvious but apparently to us it
                        wasn’t…).

                    <p> When we admitted that we liked each other, one of the things we talked about was how we wanted
                        to go back hanging out (just it being us two, or in a group setting) and settled on doing more
                        things just the two of us. Seeming great on paper we tried studying together… The day that I
                        think back on the day we studied at the science center but that was 03/31/2023 so we won’t touch
                        on that here, but that does lead into our talk 04/11/023 this was the day that you asked if we
                        could talk. I thought it was over, I was like “well shit that was quick, we just admitted that
                        we liked each other.” But fortunately enough it wasn’t that, but unfortunately we decided that
                        we couldn’t study together or else we’d get nothing done. It was tragic because that was really
                        the only way we could hangout since there was alot that was winding down at the end of the
                        semester, but we managed to do it, we found time, I mean you helped me study for my 235
                        Exam:).We went to the criticer barn I was dying of flem but we that was the first photo that I
                        took of you (wouldn’t be the last 429 and counting at the time of me writing this lmao). It was
                        also on this month in which I went over to your house to watch Creed. The funny thing wth this
                        is that I was having dinner with Alex, Avery, and Eli waiting till it was time to go over but
                        then I had remembered I still needed to shave, so I rushed out of phelps to shave, and I ended
                        up cutting myself :| After getting situated I rushed over to your house and we began to watch.
                        During the move I just kept thinking to myself “man just hold her hand!” but I just didn’t know
                        if you’d like that, ultimately I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable and so I was just nervous
                        to do so, you’d always stress about the fighting scenes so in the 3rd fight of the movei I
                        remember grabbing your hand in order to calm you down, and it was just such a relief. Finally
                        probably one of my favorite moments of ours is when I bought your flowers for your SDS
                        performance. I really wanted to be there and I would’ve but Culture and Mocktails was on that
                        same day, and I

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> This month was just filled with so many things. I’ll first start off with talking about H2,
                        because this was the first actual performance that you knew and allowed me to see you dance, and
                        when I told you Shannon I was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. I loved every moment of it, and it’s
                        special to me because you allowed me to enter a place that is important and personal to you and
                        it was just beautiful. Another thing that I will say about H2 is that I got to talk to your mom,
                        to which I will admit that I was very nervous, but with that said I was grateful because all she
                        could talk about was you, and I got to see how special you are to her and it was amazing to see.
                        After H2 WE GOT TO SEE EACH OTHER MORE!!! Which I won’t complain about, and we began to do more
                        homework with each other; I mention this because to me this month marked us starting to open up
                        to each other. We started to discuss more personal things, we communicated what we wanted from
                        our relationship and how we’d navigate with it; I look back on this month and it makes me happy
                        to see that this would lead up to us having more of these conversations in the future. The next
                        thing might not pertain to us, but in a way it does to me… THE OHIO STATE GAME!! As you know I
                        went to this game (shoutout to Liam) and I just remember obsessively talking to you about this
                        game, which I am more than grateful for. Anyways back to us, I mention this because it made me
                        happy that you followed the game with me; it showed you were interested in something that I was
                        excited for and I just can’t express it but it was really special for me and so I thank you for
                        that. Although you won’t accept it, we are going to make you a Michigan fan, it’s okay for right
                        now, because we have our whole future to make you one :) Additionally this month you decided to
                        freeze with me at the parade in which we got a shit ton of expired candy :| to which I didn’t
                        care because I was spending it with you. We plotted to steal many dogs, and my spot was stolen
                        for a bit, BUT IT”S OKAY CAUSE WE GOT A PICTURE BY THE TREE!! It was also this month in which I
                        began to look for christmas gifts for you. Buying gifts for you will always stress me out and I
                        just didn’t know where to start. I made a list and I just didn’t know if you’d like it. I looked
                        everywhere and I even followed a dance mom on tik tok (shoutout to @dancemomdana) because she
                        had a couple of videos in which she would talk about things that her 13 year old daughter used
                        for dance, but again I was overthinking so I said fuck that cause I didn’t know if that would
                        apply to you - like these warm up boots that would keep your feet warm but I didn’t know if that
                        pertain to you because was that only for kids? Do you have those already? Turns out you did
                        since I saw them in one of your tagged photos… - I knew that I wanted to get you something book
                        related to which I realized I could get you “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” but with that I
                        didn’t know whether to get you the hardcover or softcover because I didn’t know which you
                        preferred - mind you I tried to get it out of you but I couldn’t because I didn’t want to
                        getting suspicious - I then got you the embosser which I was really excited for BUT I didn’t
                        know if you'd like to do that to your books, AND THEN THE EARRINGS GOLD OR SILVER. As you can
                        tell I lost sleep over this lmao. Regardless in looking for gift idea for you, it was this month
                        in which I got the idea to make this website for you, which began the journey of it, I took
                        progress picture to which you’ll see at the end, but I remember showing you the website’s code
                        and almost played myself because the title of the project was May 20th… Finally the thing I will
                        end off with this month was the note that you wrote for me (ENTER DATE). That day that you gave
                        me the note, I was just having a really tough day, I was overthinking everything in regards to
                        school, relationships, and the future.(Maybe talk about how I thought she might’ve been losing
                        feeling) I went for a run in hopes to clear my mind but it didn’t. I was then getting ready for
                        bed, and I got a call from you. When you told me to go to the bsc, I got a little stressed not
                        gonna lie cause I didn’t know what was going to happen, but then you gave me the letter. I can’t
                        tell you how many times I read that letter before I went to bed but Shannon was the best thing
                        for me at that moment. My stress and overthinking just went away, and it’s just crazy how
                        perfect the timing was. I reflected a lot that day and even now, and I just can’t get over just
                        how perfect timing is with you. I think about, I think about, I think about, and I just talk to
                        God and I know it’s him and I thank him for you. I love you Shannon.
