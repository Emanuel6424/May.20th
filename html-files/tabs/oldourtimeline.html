    <h1> Our Timeline</h1>
    <p>My point of view of the past year with my favorite person :)</p>
    <p>As the title and message below entail, this webite was made to tell
        our story and highlight moments that were not only signficant but thought I should go into a bit more detail.
        I love you so much Shannon, AND ALTHOUGH YOU ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING, I hope that you were still
        surpirsed
        nontheless and that you enjoy it. Thank you for the best year that I can ask for, and I look forward to coming
        back to
        this unfinished project and adding more to it, cause believe it or not this is just the
        beginning (You are kinda stuck with me). I'll shut the hell up now though and let you go on and read this, I
        love you once again Shannon,
        I can't wait till you come back and we can celabrate in person, with much love
        - Emanuel Sanchez</p>

        <h2>February 2023</h2>

        <div class="text-container">
            <div class="text-area">
                <p> March, March, March… Wasn’t this a month? Starting from the beginning, it would be this month on
                    03/04/2023 I got to see you dance for the first time (DANCE 49)!! I was very excited to see it, but
                    it was also really early into us knowing each other and I didn’t want to come off as creepy if I
                    went cause I didn’t know how you’d feel about it, so it get validation of going I called my sisters
                    to get advice if I should or not and well… they said no ahahaha (they thought the same thing… who
                    would’ve thought it’s not like we grew up with each other lmao). BUUUUUUUUUUT like the wingmen they
                    are Alex and Avery came through and suggested we go to Dance 49 well… more like me BUT NONETHELESS
                    WE WERE OFF TO GO SEE YOU!!! And as perusal you did amazing I just would’ve like to tell you that in
                    person but what happened? Oh yeah, I fucking froze :| And Alex clocked it, which was when I figured
                    out that he knew that we were talking lmao. After the performance though Alex and I started to play
                    FIFA and we were snapping as usual to which we talked about the conversation that you and Sophia
                    had. This would commence my headass to overthink whether or not you liked me ahahaha, because you
                    were kinda being discrete about it and so I just kinda thought you didn’t like me. Regardless I
                    really liked you but I didn’t want to come off as needy, so I told myself I would act my usual self
                    and still see where things go from here but I also had to be cool and accept the fact that it might
                    not go anywhere and to get hurt. Which I did but with every day that I go to know you more, I found
                    my feelings to growing stronger but again I didn’t know if you felt the same was so I tried to play
                    it cool, hence the infamous situation in which you told me “yeah it not like you have a crush on me
                    or anything…” and I replied with “as for the other comment, well I am not gonna comment on that”
                    which I thought hinted at that I liked you cause you know you left me speechless but I understand
                    those were a really poor choice of words, but again I was trying to play it cool!! All this would
                    eventually bring us to 03/28/2023 in which I got that snap (still didn’t have your number… ahahaha
                    my bad) asking if I liked you or not, to which I responded with “Did you wanna go for a walk?” I
                    knew I wanted to do it over a person because although I could’ve been wrong and you’d just flat out
                    tell me that you didn't like me, I was willing to take the chance because I felt it would be more
                    personal that way, and eventually when we’d date, and last I wouldn’t want to remember this moment
                    as a simple text, but instead a memory that we can reflect on and reminisce. Knowing your
                    perspective of the build-up to you asking me this question is just hilarious to me, but anyway, it
                    would be this walk in which we avoided the question for like an hour or so and after cringing
                    ourselves out for a bit (because we can’t express our feelings) we’d clear everything up by
                    admitting to each other that we liked the other (as if it wasn't obvious but apparently to us it
                    wasn’t…).</p>

        <p> Things to write about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honestly really scared for this month, I didn't want things to fizzle out. With my overthinking headass
                I
                didn't know if we were going to keep those feelings for each other, but thank god for snapchat because
                I loved watching your videos (even though I would be late to watching them at times) you were just so
                expressive and that's why I am thankful for snap because we got to be expressive and allow each other
                to see our reations and keep up with one anothers lives without needing to read it through a text, which
                didn't show emotion</li>
            <li>She told me that she missed me</li>
            <li>I attempted to make the most out of it, I came up with virtual date ideas (watching a movie, obviously
                it didn't work: show a picture of the list) </li>

        <p> Things to write about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You watched the mexico vs panama game :)</li>
            <li>She came back to Holland!!! This was exciting but very nerve wracking for me, cause it had been 2 months
                since we'd last seen each other, and I didn't know how it was going to go, I didn't want to mess
                anything up
                I think you could tell I was nervous as hell </li>
            <li>It was amazing though, I absolutly loved every second of it, and we got over our shyness</li>
            <li>I was really happy that you were able to go on our spantaneous triple minigolf date, and that you were
                able
                to play games with us after</li>
            <li>A detail that I love from this day is that we originally left to drop you off, parked outside your
                friends house
                stayed in the car, then fucking dipped back to my house ahahahaha</li>
            <li>From here we just talked, then you wrestled me for my phone BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE THE DAMN TIK TOK,
                and
                then all the sudden it happend you kissed me (07-24-2023). I was quite shocked for a moment then locked
                back in
                to get my phone but I'm honstly glad it happened that way cause it prevented the akwardness of it </li>
            <li>From that day we made the most of very opportunity we had to see each other, I know you are gonna say
                "dOn'T aPoloGiuze" but I did feel bad cause we would stay up very late, but I loved every second of it
            </li>
            <li>WE FINALLT GOT A PICTURE TOGETHER!!</li>
            <li>We slow danced</li>
            <li>But as all things do, I knew it was gonna end so I wanted to do something speically which was the
                painting
                date idea, with the shitty ass acrylic paint, that we surpisingly made work, and we produced some high
                level
                art something that of 1800s victorian era</li>
            <li>But of course I couldn't get enough of you, so an attempt to see you one last time, I made a horrible
                banana
                bread that I am greatfull that I didn't give to cause I honstly think could've made you sick</li>

        <h2>August 2023</h2>
        <p> Things to write about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>YOUR BIRTHDAY WAS COMING UP!!! I did so much research on what I should I get you but I was just blanking
                and
                freaking out, I even followed a dance mom on tik tok because she had a couple of videos in which she
                would talk about things that her daughter using for dance, but again I was overthinking so I said fuck
                that cause I didn't know if that would apply to you like these warm up boots that keep your feet warm but 
                I didn't know if you'd like since is that only reallyf or kids then I saw you had some already...</li>
            <li>Ultimentaly I went with the sweater idea, and was so worried that I would mess it up so I but it off,
                till
                the week that you go here lmao, when you had called me to see what I was doing so that we could see each
                other
                I was literally in the middle of sowing the sweater but I couldn't tell you so I said "uhhhh
                something..."</li>
            <li>When I met up with you and your mom, it was hilarious because your mom kinda teased you and you kinda
                got embrassed
                ahahaha and then we walked around but you didn't let me hold your hand cause you were on stike :| but I
                got
                away with it ;) and then Kailoni reminded me of moment that is the bain of my exisitance :|</li>
            <li>Then you're surpise birthday party happened which was also a surpirse to me because I wasn't expecting
                you to
                be there, even though it was your birthday party ahaha</li>
            <li>Then we watched la la land, and you got to open your gift, which I was really nervous about, but when
                you opened
                it I was glad that you liked, an intresting thing part of that gift is it was supposed to me like a
                matching sweater
                what we both would wear (which is why there is two) and so I was gonna add a heart and the date in which
                we
                started dating on my right sleeve and your left seleev but then I was like "no then that kinda takes
                away your
                gift since I am getting one too" so I ultimently sraped it and was maybe I'll make it again for like
                valintes or
                anervisary</li>

                that
                hard for me to say because as you know I can't express what I am feeling and so it took me minute, and
                the thing
                with that is I knew I loved you way before that, but one I wanted to do it in person, and I wanted to
                wait for the
