        <h1> Our Timeline</h1>
        <p>My point of view of the past year with my favorite person :)</p>
        <p>As the title and message below entail, this webite was made to tell
            our story and highlight moments that were not only signficant but thought I should go into a bit more
            detail.
            I love you so much Shannon, AND ALTHOUGH YOU ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING, I hope that you were still
            surpirsed
            nontheless and that you enjoy it. Thank you for the best year that I can ask for, and I look forward to
            coming back to
            this unfinished project and adding more to it, cause believe it or not this is just the
            beginning (You are kinda stuck with me). I'll shut the hell up now though and let you go on and read this, I
            love you once again Shannon,
            I can't wait till you come back and we can celabrate in person, with much love
            - Emanuel Sanchez</p>

                    <h2>February 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>February, man this was a really interesting month. Going backward in time, we had our first date
                        on 02/25/2023 at Hops. Although you already know the story, I’ll just stress the fact that
                        Shannon was nervous. Like I got ready an hour and a half early and had a YouTube video going as
                        to what not to do on a first date. Ridiculous I know but it was no help because as soon as we
                        met up, everything just flew out the window lmao. Although this happened it didn’t matter
                        because while I was partly in fight or flight you were really easy to talk to and I was able to
                        be dumb and myself (for the most part still tried to play it cool you know???). The main thing
                        was that I just couldn’t let there be an awkward silence, which from what you told me I did a
                        pretty good job of so I’ll pat myself on the back for that. The other thing was my horrendous
                        haircut. Oh my goodness, Shannon, was I stressing over my haircut since I was just regrowing it
                        from a buzzcut You know the whole thing, which is Snapchat and sending snaps, is part of the
                        story. The exact date we matched was 02/14/2023 Valentine's Day of all days lmao. I don’t know
                        exactly because I would need to download Bumble back again to check and well… I am not doing
                        that. But I say this because I knew it was a week after I was rejected from U of M. The wound
                        was still fresh and I didn’t know what to do, but meeting you would come to help me not only
                        accept it and grow, but realize I was going to be alright and I would’ve missed out on some
                        amazing things. And finally, this month would mark the beginning of an amazing unexpected
                        journey.

                    <h2>March 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> March, March, March… Wasn’t this a month… Starting from the beginning, it would be this month on
                        03/04/2023 I got to see you dance for the first time (DANCE 49)!! I was very excited to see it,
                        but it was also really early into us knowing each other and I didn’t want to come off as creepy
                        if I went, cause I didn’t know how you’d feel about it, so to validate going I called my sisters
                        to get advice if I should or not and well… they said no :| (they thought the same thing… who
                        would’ve thought it’s not like we grew up with each other lmao). BUUUUUUUUUUT like the wingmen
                        they are, Alex and Avery came through and suggested we go to Dance 49 well… more like me BUT
                        NONETHELESS WE WERE OFF TO GO SEE YOU!!! And you did amazing. I just would’ve liked to tell you
                        that in person but what happened? Oh yeah, I fucking froze :| And Alex clocked it, which was
                        when I figured out that he knew that we were talking. After the performance though Alex and I
                        started to play FIFA and we were snapping as usual to which we talked about the conversation
                        that you and Sophia had. This would commence my headass to overthink whether or not you liked me
                        ahahaha, because you were kinda being discreet about it and so I just kinda thought you didn’t
                        like me. Regardless I really liked you but I didn’t want to come off as weird, so I told myself
                        I would act myself - for the most part - and we will see where things go from here but I also
                        had to be cool and accept the fact that it might not go anywhere and to not get hurt. Which I
                        did but with every day that I got to know you more, I found my feelings growing stronger, but
                        again I didn’t know if you felt the same way so I tried to play it cool, hence the infamous
                        situation in which you told me “yeah it not like you have a crush on me or anything…” and I
                        replied with “as for the other comment, well I am not gonna comment on that” which I thought
                        hinted at that I liked you cause you know you left me speechless but I understand those were a
                        really poor choice of words, but again I was trying to play it cool!! All this would eventually
                        bring us to 03/28/2023 in which I got that snap (still didn’t have your number… my bad) asking
                        if I liked you or not, to which I responded with “Did you wanna go for a walk?” I knew I wanted
                        to do it over a person because although I could’ve been wrong and you’d just flat out tell me
                        that you didn't like me, I was willing to take the chance. After all, I felt it would be more
                        personal that way, and eventually, when we’d date, I wouldn’t remember this moment as a simple
                        text, but instead as a memory that we can reflect on and reminisce about. Knowing your
                        perspective of the build-up to you asking me this question is just hilarious to me, but anyway,
                        it would be this walk in which we avoided the question for like an hour or so and after cringing
                        ourselves out for a bit (because we can’t express our feelings) we’d clear everything up by
                        admitting to each other that we liked the other (as if it wasn't obvious but apparently to us it
                        wasn’t…).

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>When we admitted that we liked each other, one of the things we talked about was how we wanted to
                        go back to hanging out (just it being us two, or in a group setting) and settled on doing more
                        things just the two of us. Seeming great on paper we tried studying together… The day that I
                        think back on, was the day we studied at the science center, in which we could not study for the
                        life of us, and we played hangman… but that was 03/31/2023 so we won’t touch on that here, but
                        that does lead into our talk on 04/11/023 this was the day that you asked if we could talk. I
                        thought it was over, I was like “Well shit that was quick, we just admitted that we liked each
                        other.” But fortunately enough it wasn’t that, but unfortunately, we decided that we couldn’t
                        study together or else we’d get nothing done. It was tragic because that was the only way we
                        could really hang out since there was a lot that was winding down at the end of the semester,
                        but we managed to do it, we found time, I mean you helped me study for my 235 Exam after
                        all:).We went to the critter barn I was dying of Flem but that was the first photo that I took
                        of you (wouldn’t be the last 429 and counting at the time of me writing this lmao). It was also
                        this month that I went over to your house to watch Creed. The funny thing with this is that I
                        was having dinner with Alex, Avery, and Eli waiting till it was time to go over but then I
                        remembered I still needed to shave, so I rushed out of Phelps to shave, and I ended up cutting
                        myself :| After getting situated I rushed over to your house and we began to watch. During the
                        movie I just kept thinking to myself “Man just hold her hand!” but I just didn’t know if you’d
                        like that, ultimately I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable so I was just nervous to do so.
                        You’d always stress about the fighting scenes so in the 3rd fight of the movie I remember
                        grabbing your hand to calm you down, and it was just such a relief. Finally, probably one of my
                        favorite moments of ours was when I bought your flowers for your SDS performance. I wanted to be
                        there and I would’ve but Culture and Mocktails was on that same day. Regardless, once I knew you
                        were done, I went over to your house to give them to you. From there we then just sat down and
                        talked for the rest of the night. This was the second time I opened up to you regarding how I
                        wanted to be a good dad to my kids and how I didn’t want them to grow up with the same mentality
                        as I did. We ended up staying up past 2 am and I felt bad because I didn’t want to intrude and
                        keep you up, but I just loved talking to you and I lost track of time so sorry…

                    <h2>May 2023</h2>
                    <p> May was filled with such memorable moments. We had just finished school, and we had time to do
                        stuff with each other instead of doing homework. First things first, we made the infamous
                        handshake and recorded it so that we could know what was next when we did it. Looking back at
                        how awkward I used to be, hurts my soul a lot but I like how you say that you’d never change it
                        even though we were dorky, and it stuck with me and I like that we were too, because I like to
                        see how much we’ve grown with each other and how we act towards each other. It was also the day
                        in which you showed me how to dance, although it was simple I felt like shit and thought it was
                        so cool!! I didn’t know it fully but I remember constantly practicing till I got it right on my
                        own time. (This dance move is important for later) You then got to meet my friends at Tulip Time
                        which was very much unplanned because I didn’t expect it. I thought we were going to go our
                        separate ways but they tagged along lmao. I enjoyed it though and glad that you went to meet
                        them and see how we are with each other. We watched the Dutch Dancers, walked around, ate
                        carnival food, and you got to hear me scream like an absolute maniac on the carnival ride… We
                        then separated from the group, and just like you did with mine, I got to meet most of your
                        friends unexpectedly and I got to see how you interact with them which made me so happy because
                        I got to see a side of you that I hadn’t seen yet. Then I was put on the spot and was told to
                        “SHOW THEM YOUR DANCE MOVES!!!” to which I proceeded to do and I fucking killed at (I messed up
                        at the end but no one noticed). An important moment in our relationship - even though we weren’t
                        dating… well just not yet ;) - I met your mom for the first time. I thought I was chilling
                        before going into it, but as I got to Kollen I was freaking the fuck out, it became all real to
                        me, and as I was having this internal freakout BAM you and your mom appeared and all that came
                        to mind was “WHAT’S UPPPPPPPPP” like a freaking idiot ahaha. I just couldn’t believe I said that
                        let alone twice apparently!! Nonetheless, it was great to meet her and he was so kind, sweet,
                        and funny. Some funny/nice moments that stood out to me during this month were when we went on a
                        Chipotle date and went to Kollen Park. We ate our food, and we were deciding where to go next
                        but we both couldn’t choose so we just stayed in the parking lot of Kollen. I was stressing at
                        this moment because I didn’t want to you be boarded and you just ask yourself “wtf is this guy
                        on” but I honestly didn’t know what to do, so we just started talking able music and you sat and
                        listened to me talk about runaway which I was so excited to talk about and you liked it, so I
                        showed you more of my music and what I like to listen to because at that I time wasn’t sure what
                        you liked to listen to so I was just playing generic things. We then just sat there in
                        conversation which I enjoyed and my stress from earlier started to go away. We talked about the
                        earlier stages of when we started talking and you accidentally called me babe which was one of
                        the many instances in which I knew I really liked you. I say this because in the past when I was
                        talking with someone romantically and they would call me babe it would give me the ick and it
                        just made me feel weird, but when you said it - AND YOU CAN’T COME AT ME I SWEAR SHANNON - I
                        liked it, I liked it when you said it, and it made me smile. I think you caught yourself and you
                        played it off well but I couldn’t believe it. Another moment was when I went to Target for
                        Mother's Day and I saw you messing around with your friends on a shopping cart and you saw me
                        looking at you while I was talking to my friends. You immediately got off and booked it away
                        from my line of sight. Hearing your perspective of this moment is great because I didn’t know
                        that you were literally planning to leave the store but as you were discussing this with Zoey
                        and Miriam I popped out of nowhere to come and talk to you. Just how you reacted was great and
                        the reason why I came over was 1.) I wanted to talk to you and see what was going on with what I
                        saw and 2.) Although my initial plan was to not go over to you guys, I also thought “What if she
                        gets upset if I didn’t come over to talk to her since I very well saw her” I didn’t want you to
                        think I was ignoring you lmao. Finally the most important part of this month, and the day that
                        started it off May 19th - 20th, 2024. Some back story, with May term about to end I knew that I
                        needed to do it soon. I knew that I wanted to date you way before May, I like you so much, I
                        liked talking to you, and I liked every moment we had with each other, but I knew I had to wait
                        if this was going to work. I wanted us to open up a bit more, to get to know each other, so I
                        wanted to take it slow, which I am so glad that we did. With May marking the end of the semester
                        and we got to hang out outside of studying, we got to see more of each other and I just knew I
                        wanted to date you, I was sure of it. So I had to get ready, I needed to plan it all out because
                        I wanted to make it special. As I was thinking of what to do BAM Kylea texted me on group me
                        asking when I was going to make it official. I was caught off guard because I was not expecting
                        it, and I honestly wasn’t sure of telling her because I didn’t want you to find out and I wanted
                        it to be a surprise, but I was excited and told her anyway ahaha. But now the plan was set: May
                        19th we finally go eat pineapple on pizza while you try ranch with pizza at 6:00 pm, we head to
                        the Van Gogh immersive experience exhibit at 8 and I would ask you after. I was practicing what
                        I would say, me and Liam and played basketball and I practiced what I would say to you on him.
                        Everything was going to plan. We got pineapple pizza with ranch, and we headed to the Van Gogh -
                        which was so amazing. I loved experiencing it with you, and I was glad that not many people were
                        there. The thing that blew me away was when we were in the immersive room with the moving art
                        and I just remember staring at you and excited to ask you. - The immersive room was my favorite
                        and I still get mad at myself for not asking other people to take a picture of us, I was just
                        too nervous. Once it was all done we then headed back to Holland, I parked at Kollen and we were
                        about to part ways, I was going to ask you but I couldn’t get it out, idk what was going on I
                        mean I had been practicing all this time, but it was like when we admitted that we liked each
                        other all over again. Time was ticking and I knew I had to do it, and you suggested that we go
                        for a walk, and in my head, I was like “Okay good I have more time to prepare.” We walked around
                        campus, going into the BSC first to which we danced Bachata for a bit and got kicked out so we
                        had to go to campus ministries, and here I was going to ask you BUT THEN I GOT CHOKED UP AGAIN,
                        and we just started talking more. We then headed to Kollen to play some pool, and it was getting
                        late… like really late and you were getting tired. It wasn’t till you said that you should get
                        some sleep that I told myself “Stop being a bitch and do it” but I didn’t want to do it in the
                        Kollen basement, so like an asshole I asked if we could go for another walk. We went on a walk,
                        and after getting choked up again, at around roughly 2 am I asked you Shannon Rodriguez if you’d
                        be my girlfriend, and after more discussion, we began on our journey when you said “yes.” And
                        here are the moments from our first year.

                    <h2>June 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> I was honestly really scared for this month… With you leaving all I didn’t want our feelings to
                        fizzle out, it would be a month and a half till we would next see each other and I just would
                        overthink it constantly. Because of this I attempted to make the most out of the situation, and
                        tried to come up with virtual date ideas like watching a movie - did not work :| - maybe cooking
                        something, anything that I saw on TikTok, I’d add it to the list but we were both busy so we
                        couldn’t get to them, which again worried me. This is where I think Snapacht was a very
                        important thing throughout the summer. It allowed us to be expressive with reactions and be
                        updated with each other’s day without reading a text that showed no emotion or needing to set up
                        times to talk through the phone.

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> July was the best part of the break. Not only had summer research finally ended, but you came
                        back to Holland!!! We’ve talked about it before but although this was exciting it was also very
                        nerve-wracking for me because it had been 2 months since we last saw each other and I just
                        didn’t know how we’d act around each other. After that first initial meet up we got over our
                        shyness and it turned out to be the best week. We did so much; the first day we went on a triple
                        date and played golf with Liam, Catilyn, Kyle, and Jessica, to which we played games and I had
                        to take you back home… to only go back to my house and spend the whole night with each other. It
                        was on this day (time shift to Tuesday… so days i.e : Monday - Tuesday) July 24th we would end
                        up having our first kiss. Not the most common lead up of having a first kiss due to the fact
                        that we were literally wrestling for my phone SINCE YOU WANT TO SEE THE DAMN TIK TOK, but
                        probably the best way since it prevented the awkwardness of it, which I was very thankful for.
                        From that day we made the most out of every opportunity we had to see each other, and I know you
                        are rolling your eyes and telling me not to “aPoloGize” when I say sorry for staying up late but
                        I did feel bad, but I love every second of it. This month or should I say week marked our
                        “first'' picture together, which we were both pretty excited to finally have, which you can’t
                        tell is the background of this website. On one of the nights you asked if I’d ever slow dance
                        with you and of course, I would; I, in fact, couldn’t wait till the day that I got to; so much
                        so that when you went to the bathroom and imminently went to my computer, and scrolled through
                        my music to find the most slow dancey song that I could think of which ended up being “He Come
                        the River'' by Patrick Waston, and when you got back we started to do so. It was such a
                        beautiful moment and one of my favorite memories I cherish. But as all things do, I knew that
                        this week was gonna come to an end, so I know I wanted to do something specifically to end it
                        off, which was the painting date, with shitty ass acrylic paint (can’t forget about it) that we
                        surprisingly made work, and we ended up producing some high-level art something that of 1800s
                        victorian era. Although this was supposed to be the last time that I saw you, I decided that no
                        and so in an attempt to see you one last time I made a horrible banana bread that I am grateful
                        that I didn’t give to you cause I honestly think you could’ve gotten sick from it. But yeah
                        after that, you were gone and we wouldn’t see each other for another month.

                    <h2>August 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> YOUR BIRTH MONTH, which means YOUR BIRTHDAY WAS COMING UP!!! This was quite stressful because I
                        was blanking as to what to get you, so I did so much research on what things to get you based on
                        what you like of course. Ultimately I went with the sweater idea and was worried that I would
                        mess it up so I put it off till the week you were getting here since I was so nervous about
                        messing it up. It’s funny cause once you got here you had called me to see what I was doing so
                        that we could see each other and I was literally in the middle of sewing the sweater so I just
                        said “Uhhhhhh something…'' smooth I know ;) I took a break from it and when I met up with your
                        mom, it was hilarious because your mom kinda teased you and you got embarrassed WHICH WAS
                        WARRANTED BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T LET ME HOLD YOUR HAND SINCE YOU WERE ON “strike” DUE TO THE
                        PICTURES :| but it was okay since baby did get what he wanted and got to hold your hand without
                        deleting any photos ;) but it was okay since I met Kailoni for the first and reminded me of the
                        moment that is the bain of my existence :|. The next thing in this month (August 24th, 2023) was
                        your surprise birthday party which was also a surprise to me because I wasn’t expecting you to
                        be there since I thought I was heading over to plan it… Nonetheless, it was great and we even
                        got to walk about and talk for a bit. I then sorta got to celebrate your birthday on Friday
                        going into Saturday :). It was August 25th and we chilled while watching La La Land… well at
                        least attempted to. It was funny because I kept looking at my watch waiting for it to hit
                        midnight but I wanted to do it secretly so that you would be surprised. I then got to give you a
                        gift, which I was nervous about, but when you opened it I was glad that you liked it. The
                        interesting thing about the gift is it was supposed to be like a matching sweater vibe thing,
                        something that we could both wear (which is why there are two) and so I was gonna add a heart
                        and the date on which we started dating on my right sleeve and you left sleeve but then I was
                        like “no then that kinda takes away from YOUR gift since I am getting one too” so I ultimately
                        scrapped it and maybe I’ll make it again for like another special event lmao.

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> BAM… school hit and we just both became extremely busy and it sucked because we didn’t get to
                        see each other as much. You became extremely busy and a bit stressed, and I remember you telling
                        me that Wednesdays were going to be your hard days. So I started origami Wednesdays with a note
                        of course. The idea was to give you one every month on a Wednesday just to try and make your day
                        since I knew that it would be your hardest day of the week. I think I got it for a good 2-3
                        months and then I just started to get slammed with school… Nonetheless, I hope it brought you
                        some joy. This month we were trying to figure our schedules out, we had conferences and events
                        to attend, like I said we were just very busy, but a very important moment happened; September
                        2nd, 2024 we told each other “I love you.” I remember we were just hanging out at Boers and it
                        was getting late and I was getting ready to leave, but you didn’t want me to leave, and neither
                        did I so you just laid on me. We laid there for quite a while, and I was just taking in the
                        moment - before this mind you, I already knew that I loved you but I didn’t know if you felt the
                        same way - and thinking about everything that I loved about you, how you made me feel, how you
                        make me act, I was just thinking about you and I really wanted to tell you but again I was
                        nervous. It was really hard not because I was unsure, I knew I was sure I loved you and I
                        would’ve said it earlier but I wanted to do it in person and wanted to wait for the right
                        moment, but it’s hard for me to express what I am feeling and I didn’t know you felt, so it took
                        me a minute. Heck, I almost even backed out but I am sure you already knew what was coming and
                        so you told me to backtrack, which I knew at that point I couldn’t and so I said it, and so did
                        you, and I remember just laying there happy and in comfort with the person I love. I love you so
                        much Shannon, and I could keep writing just how much I do in this section but we don’t have
                        enough time so I’ll express it throughout the rest of these months :)

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> October was a fun month with fall break falling on it - no pun intended ;) - I got to do a lot
                        firsts, in regards to Fall things and I got to do them with you! I remember I told Liam that I
                        was gonna do this with you, and he was shocked but then was a little disappointed that he wasn’t
                        going to be there lmao but he stressed about making sure we get a fresh pack of cider donuts
                        with some apple cider. We first went apple picking and we picked a shit ton of apples that I
                        didn’t even end up eating… literally, they all went to waste and we should’ve gone with your
                        idea of just getting one bad… To which we then went to attempt the corn maze. We fucking did it
                        Shannon not to say that I didn’t have faith in us but it was my first time and the clues were
                        just hard as fuck and I was just wondering if we’d do it, but in that little moment of distress,
                        we just acted dumb which I wasn’t mad about. We unfortunately were not able to get the cider
                        donuts so we have to make it up to Liam and make sure that we do next time. We weren’t able to
                        do a haunted house but along with the donuts, we will make sure that we do. SPIDER-MAN ALSO
                        RELEASED!! And I got to play it while you practiced making choreo, which was awesome, and I
                        appreciate you dealing with me as I talked so much about it while I was finishing the game. It
                        was also in this month in which Kailoni got hurt and you were told to pick up her part. I
                        remember you internally stressing about it because although you didn’t show it I knew that it
                        was a difficult situation to be put in. I hated seeing you like this and so I wanted to make
                        something for you to at least take your mind off it even if it was just for a bit. So I buckled
                        up and headed to my favorite place… TARGET!!! I had one issue though… Rodriguez, YOU DON’T HAVE
                        MANY FAVORITES!!! But there was one thing that I knew 2 things for sure 1.) You like peanut
                        butter and 2.) You love caffeine. I also remembered you gave me some granola bars, so I got
                        those, as for the rest of the things I just thought the mug was cute. I was thinking about
                        getting skincare, like face masks but I didn’t want what was the best and I didn’t want to risk
                        it lmao. I then packaged it neatly, and gave it to you the next morning.

                    <h2>November 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> This month was just filled with so many things. I’ll first start with talking about H2 because
                        this was the first actual performance that you knew and allowed me to see you dance, and when I
                        told you Shannon I was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. I loved every moment of it, and it’s special to me
                        because you allowed me to enter a place that is important and personal to you and it was just
                        beautiful. Another thing that I will say about H2 is that I got to talk to your mom, to which I
                        will admit that I was very nervous, but with that said I was grateful because all she could talk
                        about was you, and I got to see how special you are to her and it was amazing to see. After H2
                        WE GOT TO SEE EACH OTHER MORE!!! Which I won’t complain about, and we began to do more homework
                        with each other; I mention this because to me this month marked us starting to open up to each
                        other. We started to discuss more personal things, we communicated what we wanted from our
                        relationship and how we’d navigate with it; I look back on this month and it makes me happy to
                        see that this would lead to us having more of these conversations in the future. The next thing
                        might not pertain to us, but in a way, it does to me… THE OHIO STATE GAME!! As you know I went
                        to this game (shoutout to Liam) and I just remember obsessively talking to you about this game,
                        which I am more than grateful for. Anyway back to us, I mention this because it made me happy
                        that you followed the game with me; it showed you were interested in something that I was
                        excited about and I just can’t express it but it was really special for me and so I thank you
                        for that. Although you won’t accept it, we are going to make you a Michigan fan, it’s okay for
                        right now, because we have our whole future to make you one :) Additionally this month you
                        decided to freeze with me at the parade in which we got a shit ton of expired candy :| to which
                        I didn’t care because I was spending it with you. We plotted to steal many dogs, and my spot was
                        stolen for a bit, BUT IT’S OKAY CAUSE WE GOT A PICTURE BY THE TREE!! It was also this month that
                        I began to look for Christmas gifts for you. Buying gifts for you will always stress me out and
                        I just didn’t know where to start. I made a list and I just didn’t know if you’d like it. I
                        looked everywhere and I even followed a dance mom on tik tok (shoutout to @dancemomdana) because
                        she had a couple of videos in which she would talk about things that her 13-year-old daughter
                        used for dance, but again I was overthinking so I said fuck that cause I didn’t know if that
                        would apply to you - like these warm-up boots that would keep your feet warm but I didn’t know
                        if that pertains to you because was that only for kids? Do you have those already? Turns out you
                        did since I saw them in one of your tagged photos… - I knew that I wanted to get you something
                        book related to which I realized I could get you “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” but with
                        that, I didn’t know whether to get you the hardcover or softcover because I didn’t know which
                        you preferred - mind you I tried to get it out of you but I couldn’t because I didn’t want to
                        get suspicious - I then got you the embosser which I was excited for BUT I didn’t know if you'd
                        like to do that to your books, AND THEN THE EARRINGS AND CHOOSING BETWEEN GOLD OR SILVER. As you
                        can tell I lost sleep over this lmao. Regardless in looking for a gift idea for you, it was this
                        month that I got the idea to make this website for you, which began the journey of it, I took
                        progress pictures which you’ll see at the end, but I remember showing you the website’s code and
                        almost played myself because the title of the project was May 20th… Finally, the thing I will
                        end off with this month is the note that you wrote for me (November 20th, 2023). That day that
                        you gave me the letter, I was just having a tough day. I was overthinking everything in regards
                        to school, but mainly our relationship, and our future. It had been a while since we had seen
                        each other, and we weren’t talking as much. I was starting to worry if you had been losing
                        feelings, and it killed me. I couldn’t do homework, so I decided to go home but before I’d stop
                        by the store to get a snack. On my way I saw you, I was out of it but I also didn’t want you to
                        notice that, so our conversation was short and not like how we regularly communicate. This
                        killed me even more, and I went for a run in hopes of clearing my mind but it didn’t. I was then
                        getting ready for bed, and I got a call from you. When you told me to go to the BSC, I got a
                        little stressed not gonna lie cause I didn’t know what was going to happen, but then you gave me
                        the letter. I can’t tell you how many times I read that letter before I went to bed but Shannon
                        was the best thing for me at that moment. My stress and overthinking just went away, and it’s
                        just crazy how perfect the timing was. I reflected a lot that day and even now, and I just can’t
                        get over just how perfect the timing is with you. I think about, I think about, I think about,
                        and I just talk to God and I know it’s him and I thank him for you. I love you, Shannon.

                    <h2>December 2023</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> December was short due to the semester ending, regardless it was the month filled with relaxing
                        events. We had Charcuterie night with Kylea, Josh, and Kailoni. It was the first time doing one
                        of these, and it was nice just to be with you and see how you interact with your friends as
                        always, we could perfect that Charcuterie board. We then had our own Christmas celebration where
                        we made snowflakes and watched Elf (for the first time), all while I was dying from a stuffy
                        nose (I'm so glad that I didn’t get you sick). We then also opened our presents which you did
                        amazing with them. I remember always talking about Bruce and wanting to buy it but I was
                        probably never going to till you got it for me (Lesly almost stole it), and the mug was just
                        perfect, I love the sweater, and I never finished all the chocolate cause I physically couldn’t.
                        My favorite part though was when you opened your gifts and how the execution of opening the
                        embosser didn’t go as planned but as soon as you noticed what it said I just couldn’t get over
                        your reaction. Then BAM Christmas break happened, we needed to leave, and best believe I missed
                        you as soon as we had left, and it showed… As you might’ve heard, that's all I could talk about
                        when I got shit-faced on my birthday. I remember saying and thinking that I wished you were
                        there but as you heard and so did I, I said a lot more such. Apparently, I said that I love you
                        and that I missed you a lot which were all true statements but I thought I was just thinking
                        them not saying them out loud lmao; but I said those things because I meant them and because I
                        want to share every good and fun moment with you that I have, and I know you being there
                        would’ve made it 100x better. Regardless I got to call you that night after I woke up from my
                        mini coma, and I remember being so happy while I acted dumb. Another thing that I enjoyed from
                        this month was our phones - obviously - but specifically when we’d ask each other meaningful
                        questions. Your responses were just so thoughtful, and they made me reflect on my answers, I
                        just loved hearing what you had to say.

                    <h2>January 2024</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> I was excited for January 1.) because I got to see my amazing girlfriend 2.) classes seemed fun
                        (How wrong I was with that) and 3.) We had a mystery date planned for January 12th. For the
                        date, we were supposed to attend the candlelight show and get dinner. It was something new and
                        we were getting out of Holland so it would be something new and nice. Before this week, the snow
                        wasn’t much and the weather seemed to be nice, OH HOW WRONG WAS I TO ASSUME THAT!! OF COURSE
                        THERE WAS A SEVERE WEATHER STORM ON SPECIFICALLY THAT DATE. Dude, it was so unfortunate and I
                        was just baffled, regardless as long as I am with you I am more than happy and we made the most
                        out of it, we got food and just chilled :) Through Christmas break, I had shown you a little bit
                        of the project, but it was this month that I started to talk about it more because I like to
                        give you insight into what I am working on and how the process is coming along. I was excited to
                        show you the progress of it. I just love talking to you and sharing everything with you but this
                        was your gift so I couldn’t which made me sad. It was also this month that we went to Winter
                        Fantasia. You know the story of me finding out three days before the actual dance and freaking
                        out because I planned on asking you but I thought I had till February. While yes I could’ve just
                        said “Hey wanna go?” I wanted to make it more meaningful and special, it would’ve been our first
                        actual dance together and it just didn’t sit right with me asking you like that. SO before we
                        met up to do homework together I took the time… a lot more time than I expected actually to make
                        the origami flowers, a lot of the time was used on trial and error, trying to perfect the
                        flowers, how I want to position, but it was all worth it in the end because I love making you
                        happy, and your smile and excitement just brought so much joy to me. I remember you saying how
                        you didn’t expect me to ask you cause dances weren’t really my thing which they aren’t, but
                        although this wasn't like actual dancing dancing, it was a dance and I not only wanted to have
                        that experience with you but I knew that you enjoyed going to them so I knew I had to ask you.
                        You looked absolutely amazing, and although it was a shaky start to the night, and I didn’t
                        really know how to dance socially, I still enjoyed my night with you and we got to spend the
                        rest of the night with each other. We also went to see the magician, and he ended up being way
                        better than we initially thought. It was cool seeing your reactions and how sometimes you were
                        just as shocked as I was. I wished we would’ve gotten up there when he mentioned that he needed
                        a couple. We then ended the night dancing at DeVoss and you showed me a bit of modern, which as
                        if my respect for you wasn’t high, after doing this it’s even higher. We also decorated cookies
                        which I got 3rd place (I believe)!! Which I was really surprised at. This was also the month in
                        which you asked if we could go to church together. I was so happy when you asked me this because
                        I’d always wanted to go with you but you would go with your friends. I didn’t want to intrude
                        because I wasn’t sure if it was just a you guys thing, which reflecting back on that thought it
                        was pretty stupid of me to think that lmao, but regardless I was excited but nervous at the same
                        time; but I’ll get into that later since we wouldn’t be able to go to church till later lmao.

                    <h2>February 2024</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> This month felt like such a blur. There were just so many things going on at one time. I got to
                        see you in DANCE 50 SHANNON. YOU ARE LITERALLY APART OF HISTORY AND AS ALWAYS YOU KILLED IT EVEN
                        AFTER MY HEADASS GOT YOU sick… I am sorry about that again. I can’t stress it enough and I
                        honestly lost count as to how much I mentioned you dancing and how I love seeing you doing the
                        very thing you love because it means the world to you and seeing how much you work for it, then
                        being able to see it pay off is just awesome. My favorite show out of everything - not say that
                        I didn’t like all of them cause I did!! - had to be the second week on Friday when I saw your
                        mom and the old couple. Although I am always nervous to talk to your mom - especially since it
                        was just us two - it’s always great and different from the others because 1.) not only was she
                        hilarious - I see where you get it from - but 2.) I also got to see more of a glimpse of you
                        from another perspective. I didn’t mention Valentine's this month because we were both really
                        busy so we didn’t have the time to celebrate but we made up for it in march lmao. It was also
                        this month in which you started to grow suspicious of the website and in my notes that I wrote
                        done for each month as these events were happening I wrote “You found out about the website :|
                        (But I got a plan… ;))” yeah well that plan did not work for shit ahaha. One other thing that I
                        wanted to mention was the interview for Howmet. I bring this up because I was stressing hard
                        about the interview but I remember you had secretly given me a note and during the interview,
                        I’d look at that note for reassurance that I was doing good, and it would calm me down; I just
                        thought I’d mention that because you do keep me grounded and I wanted to give you credit for
                        doing good in the interview. Finally this month I wanted to mention how slowly but surely we
                        started to open up a bit more specifically about our future. We talked about two things. I'll
                        start with the one in which we briefly discussed (I say briefly cause we both got nervous) when
                        you came back from the FUEL Retreat. You had seen a TikTok that I saved that talked about the
                        future I wanted with you and it showed images of people, having a house together, getting
                        married, having kids, and growing old. I got embarrassed and you uttered words - in an attempt -
                        to make me feel better at least but backtrack. That is where you messed up and I put the
                        spotlight on you. I forced it out of you and you said “Cause I want to marry you.” I froze up.
                        Not because I didn’t know what to feel, but because all I felt was happiness. Here stood the
                        girl that I was so in love with, and she felt the same way about our future. Before this moment
                        whenever you gave me another reason to fall in love with you, I’d repeat “I’m going to marry
                        this girl,” and in that brief moment, I realized that it would happen. It stopped right there
                        because we couldn’t discuss it any further because we both got nervous and moved on before we
                        could. The other thing was when you mentioned where we’d end up after school which stressed you
                        out. We talked about long distance being scary and I brought up the idea that a lot of comp sci
                        jobs are remote. You didn’t like this - even to this day, you don’t like this - because of my
                        dream of living in New York or California. I understood where you were coming from, but as I
                        said previously those dreams were made when I felt alone and was being selfish. I felt okay
                        being alone and I didn’t consider just how far away my loved ones would be, because I was so
                        used to them being close to me. I met you and it made me reflect and release just how much I
                        love sharing moments with the people I love. It made me happy and brought me excitement, but I
                        realized if I did leave and decided to be selfish I wouldn’t have anyone to share those awesome
                        moments with, especially if it wasn’t you. You might be saying to yourself “But still” to which
                        I respond with “But no.” People grow and dreams change, would it be cool to live in New York or
                        California yes of course but I’d have no one, especially you. There are other factors that we
                        have to get through for us to start living with each other and I get that, but that’ll just be a
                        couple of years to which yeah I could go to New York, but I don’t want to permanently stay there
                        if it’s not going to be with you, to which I say that we’ll figure it out I promise because I’m
                        going to marry you.

                    <h2>March 2024</h2>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> Ahahaha do you want to know what my first note for March is? “Website plan did not work:|'' BRO
                        WHY DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT!! It’s okay though cause I got back at you by teasing you and showing
                        everyone else… I know I am an asshole. First thing first we got to celebrate Valentine's but
                        more importantly WE GOT TO BUILD LEGOS!! JK Valentine’s is important but LEGOOOOOOOOS!! Anyway,
                        I not only loved that fact as you could tell but we got to play the “we aren’t really strangers”
                        the couples edition. I decided to buy this game over Christmas break because my favorite part
                        during break was when we’d call each other and we’d ask each other questions that required more
                        than just one word; I loved how the responses each of us gave and to me at least for me had me
                        reflect, so I know I had to get it for us so we could just pull a couple out and ask whenever
                        without needing to use up all of our brain power to come up with some lmao. It was also this
                        month in which we started to talk about our future. It’s a big subject, and we are both
                        overthinkers and don’t like to get our hopes up. Because of this, I believe we were scared of
                        the future and we didn’t know what could happen which scared us. Because of this we never talked
                        about it; we both wanted the other in their lives but again life is uncertain. It was this month
                        in which we didn’t care and we told each other we would fight for one another, and we started to
                        plan our future. We talked about living with each other, marriage, and children, and it made me
                        happy because I had always thought about this but now I was sharing it with you, and I was happy
                        to consider your future instead of assuming I would be, it felt like a promise, a promise that I
                        will keep forever. After talking about it for so long, our schedules finally cleared up and we
                        were able to go to church together. As I said before I was excited to go with you, but I was
                        also nervous because I hadn’t been to church in so long. Before this, as you know I was
                        stressing about school and whatnot, but I was mainly concerned with getting an internship. We
                        were three months out before the summer, I applied to so many positions, was receiving rejection
                        letter after rejection letter, and had only one interview. It was constantly on my mind because
                        I needed something if I was going to stand a chance of getting a job after I graduated. March
                        03, 2024, we walked into Blvd church, and the service started. I remember everyone was singing,
                        and my mind started to wander, and my head started to look around. It was as if I couldn’t focus
                        with all the stress and anxiety I had but for some reason, my eyes wandered towards the cross
                        with a purple ribbon hanging over it. I remembered it being silent at that moment and thought to
                        myself how beautiful it was. I then tried to refocus on the service but my focus would just go
                        back to the cross. I can’t describe it but I took that moment to talk to God, and I told him “I
                        trust you, and I give you all my stress. I trust you.” And at that moment my stress did go away.
                        I learned to do that because of you Shannon. I never really had a deep relationship with God. I
                        mean I believed in him, but I wouldn’t go to church, I didn’t really pray, nor would I just sit
                        down and talk with him; I wanted to have a relationship with him but I didn’t know where to
                        start, that was until I met you. You started sharing your thoughts with me about God, your
                        experiences, and what you’ve learned from Church and talked about with FUEL. You didn’t know but
                        all of that acted as a starting point for me to have a relationship with him. I believe that was
                        one of the reasons why he put you in my life, and I thank him for that, and I thank you for
                        acting as a vessel for him to speak to me. I tell you this moment because just two days later,
                        on March 05, 2024, I would receive an email from Howmet to see if I could have a quick call. I
                        got excited, but it wasn’t confirmed, so I didn’t know if I had gotten it. I remember getting
                        out of work and waiting for the call. I was getting nervous, but I was wearing the black sweater
                        that I’d given to you the day before, and it smelled like you. I remember smelling it and
                        telling myself it was going to be okay. I got the call and they told me I had gotten the
                        position and I couldn’t believe it. I hung up and cried tears of joy, I then reflected on when
                        we went to church and I looked up to God and thanked him, I thanked him a lot. It was such a
                        crazy and relieving moment and in my joy, all I could think of was you, and couldn’t wait to
                        tell you. We then met up after the WOCU event and I remember you were just as excited and it was
                        just awesome sharing it with you. Spring break started and I first went to Ann Arbor, to visit
                        Liam and do some work, which is where I got the main bulk of the project. I was stressed at this
                        point because I had only 2 more months to finish it and it looked so plain, the colors were
                        horrible, and I just didn’t know how to personalize it and make it look nice. I got the
                        background done, which I was a bit proud of because I redid it so many times because there was
                        so much detail and I didn’t know how to correctly do your hair right (your hair took me the most
                        time to get decently right). I then found a color pallet that I liked and that went well with
                        the color yellow. I then figured out how to have the text fit in each of the divs, and how to
                        make them appear and disappear. I would have to tell you all of this over the phone because
                        there was so much to it and it stressed me out because I thought I was going to need to scrap
                        it, and again I wanted to tell you everything that I did but couldn’t tell you because YOU
                        COULDN’T SEE IT JUST YET!! After visiting Liam, it was then YOUUUUUU TIME!!! And we got to go to
                        Chicago together. I got to ride the train for the first time and idk why but I thought it would
                        be faster :| regardless we couldn’t find each other for the first part which stressed me out,
                        but after we did we had just a great time. We tried to stick to the plan but a lot of the things
                        were closed which I stressed about a bit because I wanted to make it special for us but I
                        realized as long as I was with you, it didn’t matter, because as long as I was with you that’s
                        all I needed. We walked a crap ton and there was quite a lot to do without breaking the bank
                        which benefited us. It was just an amazing experience and it just excited me for the future when
                        we can live with each other and we just explore and do whatever appeals to us. We have to do it
                        again cause there is just way more to do. But then came the thing that we both dreaded which was
                        leaving. I remember getting in the line to the train and being sad. I just wanted to stay with
                        you a bit longer and my whole mood just shifted. A pretty big moment for me this month was on
                        March 24th, 2024. This was the weekend after spring break, and I had gotten back from
                        celebrating Lesly’s birthday, and you had gotten done doing homework with the girls. We then got
                        to talk in the MSO, and you addressed something pretty big that we both needed to do and work
                        on, we needed to open up more and be okay with being vulnerable. I was scared too, but I knew
                        that I needed to if we wanted to let this relationship grow, and so we both shared vulnerable
                        moments and we cried together. We both were scared to do it but at that moment I felt so close.
                        I got to show you more of me and I got to see a side of you that I hadn’t seen, and I feel like
                        it was an important step in our relationship. I love you so much Shannon, and a thing that I
                        hope to do throughout this relationship is try - in any way that I can - to heal you during your
                        dark time and be an outlet for you to talk through it. You're one of the strongest people I
                        know, but you don’t have to be strong alone and I want to be there when you are having these
                        tough days, or when you aren’t feeling yourself. I want to be there to remind you that you are
                        doing amazing, that you are beautiful, and remind you that you’ve grown. I know it’s gonna take
                        some time for us to both do this but we got more than enough time to make it happen.

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> LET THE SLEEPOVERS COMMENCE. I know we had done it here and there but I believe April was when
                        we just started doing it almost every day ahaha. I didn’t care though because that meant I got
                        to cuddle and sleep with my favorite person and I never slept better even though we at times
                        didn’t really sleep. This month in itself felt like a blur as well. I got to help you film for
                        your Ped classes, which I had so much fun doing because I just gotta act like a goofball, and I
                        was happy that you made a bloopers video of us just acting ourselves and being dumb. We also had
                        Culture and Mocktails, which was important because we finally got to attend a formal MSO event
                        together ahahaha. It was great, the venue was beautiful, my date was just the perfect person to
                        go with and she looked stunning. I got to meet Leo for the first time which was so funny because
                        you can’t take your eye off that boy not for one second, and we got to dance bachata and cumbia.
                        I’m not sure that I wrote this here for now but I believe in March 2023 I practiced how to dance
                        these styles more especially since you had told me that you dance bachata in high school. I did
                        this so that I could dance with you and because you could dance to it with Latin music which I
                        loved. I KNOW I WAS A FUCKING SIMP SO EARLY BUT STILL DON’T COME AT ME. Anyways coming back, I
                        was happy that we were able to do it, and you even show me how to salsa dance which I absolutely
                        fucked up on. We then got some awesome pictures. This was also during the time in which we had
                        to do bullshit essay 2 for philosophy but it was good because we were going through it together.
                        We got a bunch of snacks which took us a whole week, we then got kicked out and we did.. You
                        guessed it… SLEEPOVERRRRRRR and try to work on them in my room. I felt really bad because the
                        Celsius was warring off and you were exhausted but it was a great night because I got to be with
                        you and we were studious!! to finish and I am still trying to recover from it. I ALSO GOT TO SEE
                        YOU DANCE IN CODA, which oh my goodness was just unbelievable and I enjoyed every moment of it.
                        Getting there in time was stressful because I was leaving Ann Arbor later than I wanted to but
                        nonetheless, I was able to get there just in time while not being stinky. We also got the chance
                        to go to Spring Fling, and got what is my favorite photo from the photo booths that we’ve been
                        in which are the “Still Best Friends.” Then fucking exam week hit us, and we had to be studious
                        for the rest of the month going into May ;)

                    <p> </p>
                    <p> We made it through Junior year together. It seemed like everything went by so quickly and it was
                        just about to get quicker. You and I both had 2 weeks till we needed to leave. It was stressful
                        but we made the most out of it. Thursday during finals week was pretty cool because we would
                        gift Alex something to say thank you for letting me eat free but also Thursday would come to be
                        - or so we thought - the last time in which we could sleep over, as usual, we got snacks and
                        were going to watching a show/movie but what was different with this was that not only were we
                        going to play card games while watching a show/movie but we were gonna get drunk together for
                        the first time, which was just so fun. We were both just goofy, I was surprisingly invested in
                        Bring It, and it was just all around a good time as usual. It was also this month in which we
                        picked our song “Japanese Denim” by Daniel Caesar. After almost a year we finally got a song,
                        and I am so happy that it's this one. I remember showing it to you for the first time when we
                        were doing homework with Kylea and Josh and you loved it. From that moment I hoped that it would
                        be this one because of what the lyrics say, and two specific lyrics stick out to me. “Never
                        would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie,” you came into my life unexpectedly, and I
                        fell in love with you. It is important it is to have love in a relationship and act as a couple,
                        but it is also important that the couple act as best friends, homies; Shannon that’s exactly
                        what you are to me as well, I love you and you're an amazing girlfriend and you are my homie,
                        and how lucky am I to have both the love of my life and a best friend for life all at once. The
                        other lyric that sticks out is when he says “Forever’s a long time” and it is; and it makes me
                        happy cause that's the amount of time we have together, Forever, and I wouldn’t want to spend it
                        with anyone else. Throughout the weeks we got to see each other and we had more sleepovers, you
                        got to meet my family, we got deep-fried Oreos, you came with me to Liam’s and we watched the
                        fireworks. The main thing that I want to talk about is Sunday, May 12, 2024. The day started
                        great, we both laid in bed enjoying each other's company while cuddling. We had church in the
                        morning so we had to make sure we got ready early since we would be going to Spring Lake, and we
                        were also hungry. We couldn’t decide what we were feeling, so we had to taste test the snacks
                        and see what we were feeling - I think before that though I knew I wanted to take you to the
                        biscuit because I have always wanted you to try it and they both have sweet and savory things, I
                        just didn’t know if we would have enough time - we were both in a sweet mode so we when to the
                        biscuit since I knew they had sweet stuff. We got to show you a little more about the area in
                        which I grew up, and we ate amazing food. We then headed off to Church. It was absolutely
                        beautiful and we debriefed about the message. We then headed back to Zoey’s to drop you off and
                        we just started talking. You mentioned how you needed a new journal because the one was filling
                        up. You said how you were excited to get a new one, that you had it since freshman year of high
                        school. We talked about how it was exciting and I mentioned that you could get one from Paris so
                        that when you look at it you have the memory of your travels. Your face lit up with joy and you
                        excitedly said “Yeah”... you said yeah… and your energy shifted. I remember being so excited
                        with you, but you went silent and I felt your energy shift. I looked over to you and saw you
                        tearing up. I said it was going to be okay, that we both have amazing opportunities in front of
                        us, that these would help us grow and it would benefit our futures. You replied “I know but I’m
                        going to miss you.” Before this, when we would have these types of conversations, I had always
                        tried to be optimistic. I would tell you that it would just be a short period of time. We had
                        done this before. We would get to see a glimpse of what the future holds for us and how that was
                        exciting. I would tell you these things to calm you down and make you feel better; but at that
                        moment as we grew closer and closer to Zoey’s house, I realized that when I told you those
                        things it was also a way for myself to feel better and not think about it as much, it allowed me
                        to avoid those realities; but as the minutes counted down and I saw you tearing up I couldn’t
                        escape it any longer. It all started to hit me that I wouldn’t be able to see you till August,
                        and with the time zones we wouldn’t be able to talk as much for a couple of weeks. I started to
                        get emotional, and I just couldn’t hold it in. I mean yeah we had done this before, but this was
                        internally different because we had so much love for each other and we had grown close to one
                        another. This was the person that I knew I wanted to marry, the love of my life, my person, the
                        one I felt the safest with and I wouldn't be able to see her. We parked and we just sat in the
                        car, holding each other's hand, then hugging as we tried to comfort each other. You then had to
                        leave, and I drove back. The whole car ride, I just couldn’t stop thinking about you and our
                        situation, I then got home and read your letters, and boy if you think I was going through it
                        earlier, I broke down. Everything you had to say about me and our relationship just hit me hard.
                        I love the gift, and I loved seeing what you had to say. It was also so fun to see the different
                        perspectives on the same moments we wrote about. I can’t express it enough and I know you have
                        heard it many times throughout these letters, but I don’t care. I love you so much Shannon, and
                        I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

        <h1> Outro </h1>
        <p> You made it through!! Happy Anniversary Shannon, I love you so so much. I hope you enjoyed the website and
            that you were at least a little bit surprised. I am happy that I can finally show you and that I can talk
            about you, like the areas that I have trouble with when creating the layout, how it works, and more
            specifically what I learned throughout the way because that is a big thing that I love doing when I work on
            these things. I want to thank you for always being there for me and coming along on this journey of life.
            You’re so caring, smart, and determined, and can’t forget beautiful ;). I can’t wait to spend the rest of my
            life with you and go through not only the highs but also the lows. It’ll be hard at times but I’ll always
            fight for you, and when I come out of those lows not only will our relationship be strong but we’ll both
            come out of it stronger too. Thank you for the best year ever and I can’t wait to see what’s in store for us
            next :) I love you Shannon Rodgriguez.

        <p>Love yours,
